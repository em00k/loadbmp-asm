Things NOT yet finished/ported.
   Gamepads
   Some esxDOS functions  (F_FSTAT, F_STAT, M_GETDATE)
   128K SNA files are not currently loading
   File dialog (F2) will not work on OSX due to windows Forms not working in x64 mode in mono

   Due to the way openAL appears to work, things aren't as smooth as i'd like. Disabling audio (-sound) will smooth out movement for now...
   Probably a few more things....



V1.18
-----

Fixed sprite transparency to use the index before the palette and colour conversion is done
-r on the command line will now allow CSpect to remember the window location, is if you move it somewhere, it'll start up there again next time.

Timex Hi-Colour mode fixed

M_GETDATE added to esxDOS emulation (MSDOS format)

#CSpect Plugins
======================================================================================
An example (empty) plugin is provided.
Write a DLL based on the iPlugin interface, and implement all members of that interface.
// access types
public enum eAccess
{
    /// <summary>Capture all READ data comes from this port</summary>
    Port_Read = 1,
    /// <summary>Capture all WRITE data to this port</summary>
    Port_Write = 2,
    /// <summary>All reads to this address come from this plugin</summary>
    Memory_Read = 3,
    /// <summary>All writes from this address come from this plugin</summary>
    Memory_Write = 4,
    /// <summary>Next register write</summary>
    NextReg_Write = 5
};


bool Write(eAccess _type, int _port, byte _value )
---------------------------------------------------
On write access this function is called with the access type, port and byte being written.
If you use the value passed, you can return TRUE to indicate you've used the value, and no 
more extensions or internal functions will be called.


byte Read(eAccess _type, int _address, out bool _isvalid)
---------------------------------------------------------
On read access to the requested address/port/reg, this function is called.
_isvalid should be set to true if you "use up" the value, or it'll be pased onto 
other plugins, or the internal functions will be called.


List<sIO> Init( iCSpect _CSpect )
---------------------------------
Initialise the plugin. iCSpect it an interface back into the emulator that allows you to
Peek,Poke, IN,OUT, and Set/Get Nextreg values.
returns a list of IO request structures.


void Quit()
-----------
Is called on exit, letting you free up unmanaged system resources.

Manual SDCARD setup 
-------------------
Download the latest SD card from https://www.specnext.com/category/downloads/
Copy onto an SD card (preferably 2GB and less than 16GB as it's your Next HD for all your work)
Copy the files "enNextZX.rom" and "enNxtmmc.rom" from this SD Card into the root of the CSpect folder
Download Win32DiskImager ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ )
make an image of the SD card
start CSpect with the command line... 

"CSpect.exe -w3 -zxnext -nextrom -mmc=<SD_CARD_PATH>\sdcard.img"

I'd also recommend downloading HDFMonkey, which lets you copy files to/from the SD image. 
This tool can be used while CSpect is running, meaning you can just reset and remount the image
if you put new files on it - just like the real machine.
This tool also lets you rescue files saved onto the image by #CSpect - like a BASIC program
you may have written, or a hiscore file from a game etc.
I found a copy of this tool here: http://uto.speccy.org/downloads/hdfmonkey_windows.zip
